# IfMyPlaylistWas

A Next.js web application using **shadcn/ui**, **Groq API**, **Spotify Web API**, and **Supabase** to analyze any Spotify playlist URL and return fun, creative interpretations of what the playlist would be if it weren’t a playlist — such as an **animal**, **object**, **famous figure**, **weather**, **aesthetic**, and more.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User pastes a Spotify playlist URL.
2. Backend fetches playlist details (tracks, artists, features) from Spotify.
3. Data is sent to **Groq** for interpretation.
4. The app generates fun outputs like:

   * "If your playlist was an **animal**, it would be..."
   * "If your playlist was a **famous person**..."
   * "If your playlist was a **movie genre**..."
5. The result is saved & cached in **Supabase**.
6. Returning users instantly get past results without re-analysis.
